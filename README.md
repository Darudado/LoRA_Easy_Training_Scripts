# Updates

## 05/30/2026
- Swap to using uv instead of pip. If you have an existing install, git pull first, then run the typical update script, otherwise you may have to run the updat script again should it fail.

## 02/22/2026
- Fix handling for forward pass and weight references for kohya's lora implementations to address excessive system memory using --use_ramtorch_network with them.

## 02/21/2026
- Fix for train_network to properly track steps for state saving and resumption

## 02/19/2026
- Anima support added, including UI elements for it.
- Made refresh branch the default branch, if you need the old branch, use "flux" branch instead

## 02/01/2026
- UI enhancements and adjustments (https://github.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/pull/68) contributed by https://github.com/DraconicDragon
  - toggle-able Global Protected Tags File
  - Rectified Flow settings mainly oriented towards recent SDXL/NoobAI RF experiments (likely marked as experimental in some way, tucked into an expandable element
  - Reorganization and tweaks to layout
- make EDM2 compatible with DDP and deepspeed in FFT, and DDP + LoRA (https://github.com/67372a/sd-scripts/pull/226)

## 12/07/2025
- Fixes to ramtorch fork handling of weight's to devices where stochastic_to is applied (fp32->bf16)
- Made all gradient accumlation in ramtorch fork always fp32, casting to weight dtype as needed
- Adjusted application of ramtorch to the network in train_network, was incorrectly forcing to the base weights dtype, now left at fp32 (full modes still cast network to the full dtype)
  - This fixes fp16 handling, though bf16 is still recommended over fp16
 
After these changes, use_ramtorch_network training as it relates to glora via lycoris seems more effective. I still need to review other network types for any issues.

A larger change I made was incorporating EXPERIMENTAL support for sdxl flow matching (Based on Bluvoll et alls work: https://github.com/bluvoll/sd-scripts).

Model: https://civitai.com/models/2071356/experimental-noobai-with-rectified-flow-eq-vae

Args as pulled from Bluvoll's readme (pass as extra training args in easy scripts)
```
--flow_model Required to train into Rectified Flow target
--flow_use_ot Not needed, want info? ask lodestone
--flow_timestep_distribution = uniform or logit_normal, just run uniform
--flow_uniform_static_ratio allows static values for shift, default 2.5
--contrastive_flow_matching Magic thingie that makes training results a bit sharper
--cfm_lambda needed by the one above, default 0.05, I prefer 0.02
--flow_logit_mean needed by logit_normal timestep_distribution
--flow_logit_std needed by logit_normal timestep_distribution
--flow_uniform_base_pixels default 1048576 or 1024x1024 allows dynamic shifting based on resolutions useful for higher than 1024x1024 training.
--flow_uniform_shift allows dynamic shifting
--vae_custom_scale suggested for Anzhc's eq-vae put 0.1406
--vae_custom_shift suggested for Anzhc's eq-vae put -0.4743
--vae_reflection_padding suggested to use with Anzhc's eq-vae, my shitty experiment wasn't trained with this.
```

I did regression to make sure that SDXL non-flow matching still worked and that flow matching will run without error, I did not do complete regression of all model and configuration permutations. 

Please open issues if any are observed.

## 11/22/2025
Pushed some fixes and enhancements for ramtorch's helper for applying it to modules generally and lycoris specifically. use_ramtorch_network wasn't working as intended, now it appears to be working.

RamTorch
- now properly maintains pinning of memory for it's weights and biases, before was losing the due to reassignment vs copy. This should make it faster, as without pinning, all transfers would become blocking silently
- passes forward requires_grad from original tensor setting during ramtorch init
- now accepts and sets a target dtype, before it would always store the RAM weights as fp32 first, so now it should use less RAM and result in faster transfers. This is set in sd_scripts to align with weight_dtype.

lycoris
- now properly async transfers weights from RAM, before it wasn't. To be transparent, bad impl by one LLM vs another for that piece as not really familiar, was more thorough this time and based on testing this new approach does look to work.

sd_scripts
- Added a CUDA sync explicitly after backward in sd_scripts to make sure all streams complete 

So overall, fixed use_ramtorch_network for lycoris, improved ramtorch application to models so it should be faster and use less RAM.

## 11/21/2025
Reimplemented is_val subset support, also reimplemented making all subset parameters static for is_val or val split, this was missed when I reimplemented validation loss in the new branch. 

As a result, even if you change nothing, after updating, validation loss metrics will change given the same training settings due to the enforcement of static parameters (e.x. cropping, shuffling captions, etc, anything that introduces randomization is disabled for is_val subsets OR dynamic subsets created by val split). Ultimately this will lead to a more consistent measure of validation loss going forward.

## 11/20/2025
There was a bug with the ramtorch fork pyproject where it wasn't properly pulling in the modules directory. This has been corrected. Running update.bat or update.sh should get everything updated correctly.

I also added experimental ramtorch support to Kohya's loras, not fully tested, let me know if there are issues.

## 11/17/2025

I am currently working on a new branch to rebase off the latest sd3 from upstream sd_scripts, the new branch chain (refresh/refresh/sd-upstream) doesn't have all the features of current default branch chain (flux/flux/sd3), but runs leaner and supports newer models. I am still working on adding back features deemed useful. RamTorch is not working correctly in the existing default branch (flux), please switch to the new branch (refresh)

Right now some of the significant things that aren't present are:
- is_val subsets
- wavelet loss
- full_bf16 stochastic accumulation
- probably some other stuff I don't recall atm.

Ramtorch (Shout out to lodestone for his great work! https://github.com/lodestone-rock/RamTorch) is supported for network training, it can be applied to the base model and network/lora, in addition, optimizer state offload is implemented to two optimizers currently.

To use ramtorch:
- extra training arg use_ramtorch=True enables it for the base model
- extra training arg use_ramtorch_network=True enables it for the network/lora, NOTE, this requires the optimizer to have .to()s defined that move the parameter to the correct device, I have implemented that currently for OCGOpt and SimplifiedAdEmaMixExM, plan to see about a generalized solution to avoid having to manually update all the optimizers.
- the previously mentioned optimizers default to offloading state to CPU/RAM (controllable vis storage_device optimizer argument, e.x. setting it to CUDA would place the states in vram). Defaulting behaviors below if not explictly set:
  - If state_storage_dtype is not provided as an arg, default to training dtype
  - If state_storage_device is not provided as an arg, default to accelerator's device, unless use_ramtorch_network is true, then use cpu
- use lycoris based networks/loras, I have not tested or implemented changes to allow Kohyas's implementations to work, only lycoris

The vram savings can be absurdly massive, for example, someone I have testing was able to train a 512 linear dim, 256 conv dim locon for SDXL, BS 7, and still didn't fully fill their VRAM, ~22GB out of 24GB, ofc, filled more system RAM. Others have been running as high as BS 18 with smaller dims.

With any reasonable batch size (4+), the overhead of ramtorch and CPU offloading appears to be negligible, in fact, it may actually speed up things due to use of streams, asynchronous operations, non blocking, etc.

The quality of outputs is not degraded in anyway as far as I have observed.

I havent nesscarily tested every lycoris setting or type fully, there may be some gaps. We have a discussion thread going around RamTorch in this context at https://github.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/discussions/51, but feel free to open issues for any encountered.

## 4/13/2025 IMPORTANT
- IMPORTANT: Fixed defect related to Lycoris bypass mode

It came to my attention when I was looking through lycoris code to make enhancements, that the bypass_mode arg was not being properly handled, if you did not explicitly pass false, it would be None, and end up resolving to TRUE. This would end up bypassing weight decomposition for DoRA, as there exists no logic, despite original author's documentation, that it should be overridden to false. Now, i have fixed this in my fork so that bypass mode defaults to FALSE, and if dora is enabled, it will also be forced to false. This may have significant effects how training behaves in cases where bypass_mode was being erroneously being enabled, especially DoRA!

In essence, during the forward pass, weight decomposition for DoRA was not being applied, the bypass route would also not apply DoRA style network dropout if set.

So, all DoRAs trained without explictly setting bypass_mode to false (which I doubt most people would do) were not trained correctly / fully, as such, the full benefits were not realized.

## 1/28/2025 -> 4/13/2025
- Bunch of things, will try to compile

## 1/28/2025 IMPORTANT
- Apply float32 tiny as eps to Scaled Quadratic loss
- **Fix adaptive gradient clipping in layer mode, was incorrectly amplifying gradients smaller than the parameter, not clipping ones larger.**
  - **This will require retuning as a result!**
  - adaptive_clip, if in use, will need to be increased to avoid excessive clipping and returned. Recommend starting at 0.18.
  - Weight decay will likely need to be decreased and retuned. Recommend starting at 3e-6 if using stable weight decay, if not using swd, can start at 5e-4 or similar most likely.
  - SPAM threshold and starting step may need to be increased and returned. Recommend starting at 500 for threshold, and 10 for start step.
- Optimizer util functions: Adjust all eps to be float32 tiny by default, or if eps value set to 0
- ADOPTAOSchedule: Adjust to apply clipping on step one

# Enhancements over original
- Triton is installed for Windows and Linux, which can provide an improvement to training speed. Make sure to follow the steps at https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#install-from-wheel for Windows. Linux also requires 12.X CUDA be installed and properly setup on the paths required as per the Nvidia documentation.
- All safe to update dependencies in sd_scripts have been updated to their latest versions.
- A wide array of additional optimizers. (e.x. Compass, FCompass, FishMonger, FARMScrop, Ranger21, AdEMAMix etc.)
- A version of Compass called CompassPlus that incorporates many of the features of Ranger21.
- Enhanced versions of some optimizers with additional features made available (e.x. centralization and gradient clipping) and with stochastic rounding implemented.
- See https://github.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_scripts_Backend/tree/flux/custom_scheduler/LoraEasyCustomOptimizer for added / modified optimizers.
- Validation loss for SD and Flux loras, and SDXL finetune.
  - Use the following args under Extra Args to manage
  - validation_split - float 0.0 - 1.0: The percentage amount of all training datasets to split off for validation. Recommend a value of at least 0.1
  - validation_seed - string - A seed that used by the process to determine the images split off, order, etc. 
  - validate_every_n_steps - int - Every n steps, run validation, if not set, runs every epoch. Recommend a value of 25, depending on your effective batch size and number of steps.
  - max_validation_steps - int - The maximum number of batches of images that will be processed during a validation, recommend setting this to a high value and not worrying about it, so all images in the val dataset are processed each time.
- Options to scale IP noise gamma based on timestep or apply to last channel only.
  - Use the following args under Extra Args to manage
  - ip_noise_gamma_scaling - string(sine, linear, exponential) - The scaling, starting from timestep zero, of ip noise gamma. Recommend exponential or linear based on testing and validation loss.
  - ip_noise_gamma_scaling_exponent - float - Exponent for exponential scaling, default is 2.0.
  - ip_noise_gamma_scaling_min - The minimum of ip noise gamma to apply regardless of scaling. Recommend not using, or using a lower value than the primary value.
  - ip_noise_gamma_last_channel_only - Applies IP noise gamma to the last channel (think VAE) of the latent
- Fixed logging of max and average key norms when using lycoris
- IP Noise gamma for Flux networks/loras
- Warmup Stable Decay (WSD) scheduler, by default decay phase will match number of warmup steps, else use Extra Args and set lr_decay_steps to either a decimal (for percent of total steps) or number (for absolute steps) for decay.


# LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts

A set of training scripts written in python for use in Kohya's [SD-Scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). It has a UI written in pyside6 to help streamline the process of training models.

## Table of contents

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Installation](#installation)
  - [Windows](#windows)
  - [Linux](#linux)
  - [Standalone Backend Installation](#standalone-backend-installation)
- [Colab](#colab)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Configuration](#configuration)
- [Changelog](#changelog)

## Prerequisites

- **Git** must be installed and available on your PATH.
- **Python 3.11** is required. The installer uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage virtual environments and will automatically download Python 3.11 if it is not already installed on your system.

## Installation

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (from Astral) for fast package installation and virtual environment management. **uv is installed automatically** by the installer scripts if it is not already present — you do not need to install it manually. After installation, virtual environments are created with `uv venv --python 3.11 --seed`, which ensures pip is available inside each venv for compatibility.

### Windows

Open up a command line within the folder that you want to install to, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts -b refresh
cd LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts
install.bat
```

The installer will:
1. Download and install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if not present (via the standalone PowerShell installer).
2. Create a Python 3.11 virtual environment at `./venv` using `uv venv`.
3. Install frontend dependencies via `uv pip install`.
4. If running locally, initialize git submodules and delegate to the backend installer, which creates a second venv at `backend/sd_scripts/venv` and installs all ML/training dependencies (PyTorch, xformers, etc.) via `uv pip install`.

A few questions will be asked along the way — just make sure to answer them.

### Linux

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts -b refresh
cd LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts
git submodule update --init --recursive
./install.sh
```

The installer will automatically download and install [uv](https://github.com/astral.sh/uv) (via the standalone curl installer) and Python 3.11 if needed, then create venvs and install all dependencies using `uv pip install`.

If you specifically need to target Python 3.11 explicitly, you can use `./install311.sh` instead.

### Standalone Backend Installation

The backend can be installed independently from the frontend UI (useful for headless/remote training setups):

```bash
cd backend
./install.sh
```

The backend has its own copy of `install_uv.py` and is fully self-contained — it does not require the frontend repo to be present.

### NOTE:

If you are using one of the installers, one of the questions it will ask you is "Are you using this locally? (y/n):" — make sure you say **y** if you are going to be training on the computer you are using. This is very important to get correctly because the backend will not install otherwise, and you will be stuck wondering why it is not doing anything.

## Colab

If you wish to train LoRAs but you lack the hardware, you can use this [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Jelosus2/Lora_Easy_Training_Colab/blob/main/Lora_Easy_Training_Colab.ipynb) created by [Jelosus2](https://github.com/Jelosus2) to be able to train them.
Additionally, you can check the [guide](https://civitai.com/articles/4409/almost-local-lora-training-guide) if you have trouble setting all up. **Note:** You still need to git clone the repo and install the UI on your local machine. Be sure to answer the prompt "Are you using this locally? (y/n):" with "n".

For Colab, the installer uses `backend/colab_install.sh` which runs the backend installer with the `colab` flag. This installs uv, creates the venv with Python 3.11, installs all ML dependencies via `uv pip install`, and configures accelerate automatically.

## Usage

You can launch the UI using the `run.bat` file if you are on windows, or `run.sh` file if you are on linux.

The UI looks like this:

![Main UI Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/main_ui.png)

and has a bunch of features to it to make using it as easy as I could. So lets start with the basics. The UI is divided into two parts, the "args list" and the "subset list", this replaces the old naming scheme of \<number\>\_\<name\> to try and reduce confusion. The subset list allows you to add and remove subsets to have however many you want!

![Subset manipulation gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/subset_manipulation.gif)

You are also able to collapse and expand the sections of the "args list", so that way you can have open only the section you are working on at the moment.

![Args manipulation gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/args_list_manipulation.gif)

Block Weight training is possible through setting the weights, dims, and alpha in the network args.

![Block weight gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/block_weight.gif)

Pretty much every file selector has two ways to add a file without having to type it all in, a proper file dialog, and a way to drag and drop the value in!

![File select or dialog gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/file_selector.gif)

TOML saving and loading are available so that you don't have to put in every variable every time you launch the program. All you need to do is either use the menu on the top right, or the keybind listed.

![TOML saving and loading gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/toml_loading_and_saving.gif)
NOTE: This change is entirely different from the old system, so unfortunately the JSON files of the old scripts are no longer valid.

I have added a custom scheduler, CosineAnnealingWarmupRestarts. This scheduler allows restarts which restart with a decay, so that each restart has a bit less lr than the last, A few things to note about it though, warmup steps are not all applied at the beginning, but rather per epoch, I have set it up so that the warmup steps get divided evenly among them, decay is settable, and it uniquely has a minimum lr, which is set to 0 instead if the lr provided is smaller.

The Queue System is intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to save a config into a little button on the bottom left then allowing you to pull it back up for editing if you need to. Additionally you can use the arrow keys to change the positions of the queue items. A cool thing about this is that you can still edit args and even add or remove queue items while something else is training.

![queue manipulation gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/queue_manipulation.gif)

And finally, we have the ability to switch themes. These themes are only possible because of the great repo that adds in some material design and the ability to apply them on the fly called [qt-material](https://github.com/UN-GCPDS/qt-material), give them a look as the work they've done is amazing.

![theme switching gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/theme_changing.gif)
The themes also save between boots

![theme remembering gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/67372a/LoRA_Easy_Training_Scripts/main/images_gifs/remember_theme_on_reload.gif)

## Configuration

I'd like to take a moment and look at what the output of the TOML saving and loading system looks like so that people can change it if they want outside of the UI.

here is an example of what a config file looks like:

```
[[subsets]]
num_repeats = 10
keep_tokens = 1
caption_extension = ".txt"
shuffle_caption = true
flip_aug = false
color_aug = false
random_crop = true
is_reg = false
image_dir = "F:/Desktop/stable diffusion/LoRA/lora_datasets/atla_data/10_atla"

[noise_args]

[sample_args]

[logging_args]

[general_args.args]
pretrained_model_name_or_path = "F:/Desktop/stable diffusion/LoRA/nai-fp16.safetensors"
mixed_precision = "bf16"
seed = 23
clip_skip = 2
xformers = true
max_data_loader_n_workers = 1
persistent_data_loader_workers = true
max_token_length = 225
prior_loss_weight = 1.0
max_train_epochs = 2

[general_args.dataset_args]
resolution = 768
batch_size = 2

[network_args.args]
network_dim = 8
network_alpha = 1.0

[optimizer_args.args]
optimizer_type = "AdamW8bit"
lr_scheduler = "cosine"
learning_rate = 0.0001
lr_scheduler_num_cycles = 2
warmup_ratio = 0.05

[saving_args.args]
output_dir = "F:/Desktop"
save_precision = "fp16"
save_model_as = "safetensors"
output_name = "test"
save_every_n_epochs = 1

[bucket_args.dataset_args]
enable_bucket = true
min_bucket_reso = 256
max_bucket_reso = 1024
bucket_reso_steps = 64

[optimizer_args.args.optimizer_args]
weight_decay = 0.1
betas = "0.9,0.99"
```

As you can see everything is sectioned off into their own sections. Generally they are seperated into two groups, args, and dataset_args, this is because of the nature of the config and dataset_confg files within sd-scripts. Generally speaking, the only section that you might want to edit that doesn't correspond to a UI element (for now) is the `[optimizer_args.args.optimizer_args]` section, which you can add, delete, or change options for the optimizer, A proper UI for it will come later, once I figure out how I want to set it up.

  - First release of the new UI system. This has been a long time coming and I put in a ton of work to make it as user friendly as possible. Some Things to note, This doesn't have support for queues or block weight training for the moment, they are planned though and will be added down the line.
  - If you find any bugs, _please_ tell me, I want to fix them if something is wrong. After all, I am only one person
  - I'm adding a link to my ko-fi page as of this update so people that want to support me can! Thanks for all of the feedback of the scripts through the development time I spent on it, and I hope to continue to improve it as I go.
